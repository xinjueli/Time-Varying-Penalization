Published in : 'Unpublished; Theoritically description of Time Varying 
Penalization method.'

Description : 'Performs LASSO regression in a moving window by using BIC 
criterion to choose penalty parameter (lambda). The simulated data contains 
a break point after which the design matrix changes. Plots time series of 
lambda in LASSO regression. Furthermore, the cardinality of the active set 
q, the L2-norm of the residuals, the L1-norm of the paramter beta  and the 
condition number of the squared design matrix (X'X) are plotted.'

euclidean norm,regression, simulation, plot, visualization, historical 
moving window,time-series, estimation,L1-norm, error, beta, multi 
dimensional, multivariate normal'
